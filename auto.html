		<p class="naslovi">Carbon-ceramic discs</p>
		<p>The Brembo Group has been manufacturing carbon ceramic discs for automotive applications since 2002, when it first supplied these components for the Ferrari Enzo.
		This high performance material, made from a special mixture of powders, resins and fibres in a complex manufacturing process, has been used since the 1970s in braking systems for aerospace applications and since the 1980s in motorsports.
		Since 2000, carbon ceramic has also been used in the production of braking systems for sports cars.</p>
