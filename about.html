		<p>The 1960s.<br>
		THE ORIGINS OF A LEADER<br>
		Brembo was founded just a few kilometres outside Bergamo in 1961 by Emilio Bombassei, the father of the group's current president.<br>
		While it began as a small mechanical workshop, the experience of its founder in the mechanical sector and metallurgy was soon put to good use for prestigious <br>clients such as Alfa Romeo.<br>
		1964 was a historic year for Brembo, when the company started production of the first Italian brake discs for the spare parts market. Soon afterwards, production <br>activities were broadened to include other braking system components, and the competence and specialisation of the company and the quality of its products and <br>services earned international recognition.<br>
		This paved the way for Brembo to become the leader in the European spare part brake disc market.</p>

		<p>The 1970s.<br>
			TRIUMPHS ON EVERY CIRCUIT<br>
		When it began supplying Moto Guzzi in<br> 1972, the Brembo brand became<br> associated with Europe's best<br> motorcycles. Soon after, Brembo had<br> secured the leadership in the motorcycle<br> braking systems segment. But the<br> greatest testament to the quality and<br> technology of Brembo products came in<br> 1975, when Enzo Ferrari asked the<br> Bergamo based company to equip the<br> most prestigious racing cars in Formula 1.<br> It was not long before Brembo was the<br> leading name in the motorsports braking <br>systems segment.</p>

		<p>The 2000s.<br>
			EXPANDING THE BRAND GLOBALLY<br>
			Brembo inaugurated the new millennium with a strategy of market expansion, acquiring the Brazilian company Alfa Real Minas for the machining of automobile brake discs and the assembly of engine flywheels. Brembo also acquired the British company AP Racing Limited, which is specialised in the production of brake and clutch systems for race cars and motorcycles and for high performance sports cars. To strengthen its presence in the motorcycle segment, Brembo acquired 70% of Marchesini, a company specialised in the production of magnesium wheels for race motorcycles.</p>

		<p>The acquisition of new brands and products<br>
			From 2010 the Brembo range is complete for the parts market as<br> well: their vast experience gained in braking systems and co-<br>operation with the major automotive manufacturers has allowed<br> Brembo to offer a complete package of components for braking<br> systems at maximum levels of performance, reliability and safety.<br>
			A complete range of pads, shoes, drum brake kits and hydraulic<br> components for brakes and clutches is added to the traditional offer<br> of discs and drums intended for professionals in the parts market.<br>
			That same year, Brembo launched the new Bybre brand in India: the<br> brand dedicated to braking systems for scooters and small to mid<br> engine sized motorcycles (up to 600 cc). The new Bybre range is<br> produced in the Pune plant, which was inaugurated in 2009.</p>
